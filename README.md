# React Cube.Js

## Description:
This repository presents diverse technical solutions for integrating Cube.js with a React app within a large-scale Business Intelligence (BI) system. Designed to accommodate various UI frameworks, it offers a simple and scalable approach to incorporating Cube.js into React applications.

## Challenges Addressed:

- Time-to-Delivery: Streamlining feature delivery for both frontend and backend components.
- Correctness: Ensuring configurability and uniformity across the system, particularly regarding formulas, labels, formatting, and validation.
- Defect Rate: Maintaining a low defect rate and implementing a development pipeline to minimize the risk of introducing errors.
- Performance: Optimizing all solutions at their core, encompassing both frontend and backend aspects.


## Key Solutions:

- Modular Architecture:
  - Implement a modular architecture to facilitate feature delivery and maintainability.
  - Separate concerns between frontend and backend for clear delineation of responsibilities.
- Configurability:
  - Design solutions to be highly configurable, allowing customization of formulas, labels, formatting, and validation rules.
  - Ensure consistency across the system to avoid discrepancies and errors.
